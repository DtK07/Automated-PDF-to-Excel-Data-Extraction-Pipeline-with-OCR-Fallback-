# 📄 Automated PDF-to-Excel Data Extraction Pipeline (with OCR Fallback)

## 🔎 Overview
This project automates the extraction of structured information from a collection of institutional PDF documents and compiles the results into a clean, analysis-ready Excel dataset.

The solution is designed to handle both:
- ✅ **Text-based PDFs** (machine-readable)
- ✅ **Scanned/Image PDFs** (non-readable)

When direct text extraction fails, the system automatically switches to **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to recover the content — ensuring reliable extraction regardless of document format.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Manually extracting contact and institutional details from hundreds of PDFs is:

- Time-consuming  
- Error-prone  
- Difficult to scale  
- Inconsistent due to mixed document formats  

This project converts semi-structured PDF documents into a structured dataset automatically.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1 — Batch Processing
- Reads all PDFs from a specified folder.
- Iterates through each file automatically.

### Step 2 — Attempt Direct Text Extraction
Uses **PyPDF2** to extract text from:
- Digital / machine-generated PDFs.

If text is successfully extracted → proceed to parsing.

---

### Step 3 — OCR Fallback (When PDF is Scanned)
If no text is detected:

1. Extract images from the PDF using **PyMuPDF (fitz)**  
2. Convert images to readable text using **Tesseract OCR**  
3. Clean and process the OCR output  

This ensures scanned documents are handled seamlessly.

---

### Step 4 — Data Parsing
The script extracts key attributes such as:

- College Name  
- City  
- Email ID  
- Phone Number  
- Website  
- Institution Type  

Text is cleaned to remove OCR noise and formatting artifacts.

### Step 5 — Structured Output
All extracted data is written into an Excel workbook using **openpyxl**, producing a clean tabular dataset ready for analysis.
